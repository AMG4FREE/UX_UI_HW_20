            WasteAway is an iOS app created to address the knowledge gap surrounding recycling information.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our group felt that accessing consistent and useful information about recycling was scarce. After researching what was available on the Apple app store, it became apparent that not only is recycling and waste management a global issue, there simply aren't enough good resources available to help consumers make well-informed recycling choices.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our goal is to provide a resource users can go to access recycling information that is useful, easy to understand and easy to use.

                  After developing the style of our document, we began adding these stylistic decisions to our mid-fidelity prototype. We designed with a flexbox framework in mind so that it’d be easy to align content and make it compatible on different smartphone screen sizes. Translating the Figma design into css had some compatibility issues which we made great progress toward cleaning up in later iterations. To test our mid-fi prototype, We added script tags in the head section of our HTML. We used HotJar to create a heatmap of our pages and Google Analytics to track different metrics of user behavior on the app.

          Given our time constraints, we were only able to develop on a few features. However, there were a lot of other potential features we brainstormed that would make the app an even more useful tool.

        <ul>
          <li class="list-item">
            Create Account
          </li>
          <li class="list-item">
            Geolocation Features
          </li>
          <li class="list-item">
